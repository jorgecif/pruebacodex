This repository contains a simple web-based task manager built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Running the application

Open the **index.html** file in your web browser. You can either double-click the file or use a local development server of your choice.

## About the task manager

The interface lets you add new tasks, mark them as completed, delete tasks and filter the list to show all, pending or completed tasks.

All tasks are stored in the browser using **localStorage**, so your list will persist when you reload the page.
